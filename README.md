# Multilayer-stacking
Multi-layer stacking, or stacked ensemble learning, enhances predictive accuracy by combining predictions from multiple diverse base models. This technique is valuable because it leverages the strengths of different algorithms and models, mitigating their individual weaknesses and improving overall performance. By stacking models in layers, where each layer learns from the predictions of the layer below it, multi-layer stacking can effectively capture complex relationships in data that may be missed by individual models. It reduces overfitting by aggregating predictions from models trained on different subsets of data or with different learning algorithms, thereby enhancing generalization to new data. Stacked ensembles are versatile and applicable across various machine learning tasks, offering flexibility in model selection and consistently delivering competitive performance in both research and practical applications.
